A Garland of Vajra Gems

The Life and Liberation of the Guru

by Jamgön Kongtrul

1. The Birth and Reign of the Guru in the Land of Uḍḍiyāna

Emaho!From the vast and boundless field of simplicity,in the palace of the Lotus Array of Great
Bliss,[1]Amitābha, Buddha of Boundless Light, Sovereign of the Three Kāyas,resolves to
tame the barbaric beings of saṃsāra,to eliminate the wrong views of the tīrthikas,and to
light the torch of the genuine Dharma —by sending a buddha emanation supreme.Not someone of
mere womb-birth but only one born miraculouslyWould be able to tame gods, demons, and humans.Thus,
by magnetizing and wrathful means,from the wisdom maṇḍala of the vajra-mindthe
Lotus Lord emanates as the syllable hrīḥ.

On an isle in the pristine Kośa Sea,[2] with its eight-fold qualities,[3]on the anthers of an
untouched budding lotus he was born.The flower itself, the size of a chariot’s wheel,gleamed
with light and brillianceas the morning sun shone down.So beautiful, its adornment of
the waters! Perfect grace!At night, rainbows swirled across the boundless surface.Every other
flower must yearly change from new to old,yet the uḍumbara stalk that rose at the water’s
centrenever met growth or decline, neither summer nor winter.Instead, with its petals
always closed, it brought amazement to all.At this sight, the king’s messengers reported
what they’d found.Ministers were consulted, a sentry was dispatched,and there, never resting,
he watched the flower, day and night.Then, on the tenth day of the monkey month, in the
monkey year,the lotus petals opened.There, upon the anthers at the centre,sat a beautiful
child, enchanting to behold.Rainbows shone, flowers rained from the skies,lightning roared
and crackled, the earth shook and rumbled — good omens all.From the south came the great
king, bringing his retinue,disbelieving still, right up to the water’s edge —where he saw
the beautiful infant child sparkling with dew.In awe he prostrated before him and his voice
rose in praise:“This blessed child”, he sang, “our prince shall he be!”

He set sail across the water, to try to reach him,but without success was forced to retreat.[4]


Uḍḍiyāna’s King Dhanapāla[5] had no royal son,And had made donations over the years, giving
away many fine things,until, over time, the royal vaults ran dry.In hopes of finding treasure,
he had set out to seaand, returning, he saw the boy, exactly as described.“This, my destined
son!” he said,and boarded the ship, fetching child and lotus both.At the palace they
enthroned the boy and offered him the crown.The king made supplication to this wish-bestowing
jewel,and the wealth of the kingdom was once again restored.The prince reigned for
five years, in harmony with the Dharma,guarding the welfare of his kingdom.

The Birth and Reign of the Guru in the Land of Uḍḍiyāna.

2. The Guru Abandons the Empire and Dwells in the Śītavana Charnel Ground

One day, the Guru was resting in realizationwhen he saw the face of Vajrasattva and received
his prophecy:“How, governing a kingdom, will you benefit beings?Rather, through power, reason,
and action you will tame them!”The Guru decided to act in accordance with thisand considered
just how he might abandon the throne.“If I publicly practice the yoga of uncontrived
conduct,it will displease the king and ministers and could be my chance for escape.”Thus,
he started deliberately some unconventional yogic practices,and indeed most of the evil-minded
ministers became upset.Confiding, they sought counsel before their king:“The young
prince is doing all kinds of odd things.He should be exiled from the state for such behaviour.This
very day he must be driven out, far away from here.”Despite the king’s protesting,
they would not be swayed,so they banished him to India, the Śītavana charnel ground.There,
he subjugated the mātṛkās and ḍākinīs,enjoining them in the four unions, and liberating
the vicious.He spent five years with the ḍākinīs, turning the wheel of Dharma,and at last,
while practicing the deities of Amṛta’s Qualities,[6]he attained accomplishment, had visions
of the deities,and received their prophecy.He became known as Padmasambhava the Master
of Qualities.

the Guru Abandons the Empire and Dwells in the Śītavana Charnel Ground.

3. The Guru’s Visions of the Deities and Attainment of Accomplishments

Next, he took to the Great Hūṃ Cave,[7]with the intention to attain the great Vidyādhara’s wisdom
mind.There he trained in the deities of Śrī Heruka,slaying the male demons and joining
with the females.Perfecting yogic conduct, he spent five years there,turning the wheel
of Dharma amongst the ḍākinīs.He had visions of the deities of Śrī Herukaand in a single instant
attained both the supreme and common siddhis.He became known as Padmasambhava the Mighty
Master.

Then, he took to the charnel ground Terrifying Grove,[8]where he practiced the deities of Yamāntaka.Donning
the eight ornaments of the charnel ground,and magnetizing the ḍākinīs, he
presided as the great gaṇacakra chief.Perfecting union and liberation, he attained the supreme
siddhi.Gazing upon the face of Mañjuśrī-Yamāntaka,he attained accomplishment in the twelve
fierce activities.[9]Five years he spent there, his back against the stūpa,becoming
known as Padmasambhava the Wise Master.

Then, he took to the charnel ground Lotus Mound,[10]where he practiced the magnetizing deities
of Mighty Padma-Hayagrīva,engaging in the awakened activities of union and liberationand
turning for the ḍākinīs the Dharma wheel of secret mantra.He had visions of the deities
of Mighty Padmaand attained the supreme power of the great Vidyādhara’s wisdom speech.He became
known as Padma Hayagrīva Sambhava, the Lotus-Born, the Horse-Headed Master.and stayed
for five years, accomplishing the immeasurable benefit of beings beyond number.

Then, he took to the charnel ground Zombie Grove,[11]where he practiced the deities of Kīla’s
Activity.He magnetized every mātṛkā and ḍākinī there,performing union, liberation, and empowerment,and
turning the Dharma wheel of secret mantra.He had visions of the deities of
Vajrakumāraand attained the power to smash the obstructing hordes of māras.There he stayed
for five years, seven months, and ten days,And was known as Padmasambhava the Master of Activity.

the Guru’s Visions of the Deities and Attainment of Accomplishments.

4. The Guru Practices in the Eight Charnel Grounds, Perfecting the Unconfined Yogic Conduct
of Liberation and Union

Then the Guru left for the charnel ground Spontaneous Mound,to practice the maṇḍala of Mātryāvahanavisarjana,
Calling and Dispatching Mātṛkās.There he ate human flesh and wore human
hides.He liberated the male demons and united with the females,turning the wheel of Dharma
amongst the ḍākinīs.He had visions of the Mātryāvahanavisarjana deitiesand received the infinite
empowerments of supreme and common activity.He spent five years there, perfecting
yogic discipline,And was known as Padmasambhava the Master Sorcerer.

Then he took to the charnel ground All-Pervading Utter Joy,to practice Lokapūjāstrota, Offering
and Praising Worldly Deities.He magnetized the arrogant spirits of father, mother, and
neuter lineages;he magnetized ḍākinīs and the eight classes of gods and demons,and he appointed
them as attendants to accomplish the four activities.At the Guru’s command they pledged
allegiance,and he poured on their tongues the secret samaya substances.He became sovereign
chieftain over all worldly spirits,liberating the five poisons and uniting with the
expanse of the five kāyas.He had visions of the Lokapūjāstrota maṇḍala and attained accomplishment.For
five years, five months, and five days he remained,famed as Padmasambhava the
Master of Offering and Praise.

Then he took to the charnel ground Loka Mound,to tame without exceptionthe many malicious demons
there who harbored evil wishes.He practiced the vanquishing Sādhana of Fierce Mantras,and,
opening the Mantrabhīru maṇḍala,he remained in the samādhi known as ‘Destructive Curse’.Thus,
alike for every foreboding spirit and demon,he performed the activity of subduing,
incinerating, and casting.Bearing down in conquest, he liberated the male demonsand united
with the females, magnetizing them all,and he turned to dust all those with wrong view.With
visions of the deities of black Mahābala,he attained the empowerment and accomplishment
of liberating enemies of the teachings.And for five years, nine months, and nine days
did he remain,Becoming known as Padmasambhava the Master of Wrath and Allure.

of Liberation and Union.

5. The Guru Establishes the Dharma in the Kingdom of Zahor and Accomplishes the Level of the
Mahāmudrā Vidyādhara

The Guru Padmākara then decided to go to India,and turn throughout its lands the wheel of the
sublime Dharma.“I shall teach the genuine Dharma to all,” was his thought,but they asked,
“Who is your guru?”He replied, “I am the self-arisen guide, a buddha.Despite not having
a guru, I know the genuine Dharma.”“There is no self-arisen guide”, they said, “save for Śākyamuni.”“What
you say”, he replied, “is none other than māra,and so I flatly refuse to listen.”


Without a guru, however, he was unable to benefit others,and so he decided to attend several
qualified masters,accomplished scholars of India such asMañjuśrīmitra, Śrī Siṃha, and Vimalamitra.Of
the many scholars and siddhas whom he met,he actually attended one hundred and
eight.Training in the outer, inner, and secret dharmas of sūtra and mantra,he made his main
focus the secret mantra practices of the Great Perfectionand the subtle-body methods of
inner heat and empty-bliss as the path.Meanwhile, he did he not neglect the five sciences,
but gained proficiency in them.Merely introduced to any teaching, he immediately understood.


He then took to Zahor, in pursuit of study and practice.The king of this region was Arśadhara,an
extremely wealthy sovereign, with empress, ministers, and many subjects.He had only one
child, a daughter, Princess Mandāravā.Like a child of the gods, with every mark of excellence,unmatched
by any other, and arrestingly beautiful.Throughout the lands of India, of
China, Turkistan, and Kashmir,the kings of Uḍḍiyāna and Nepal, Persia and Mongoliaardently
competed for her hand.But she accepted no-one, remaining untarnished by saṃsāra.To practice
the sublime dharma, she cloistered herself within the palace.The Guru saw her to be a
secret disciple of empty-bliss,and turned for her the Dharma wheel of the four joys — great
bliss-wisdom.As they remained within the perfection of blissful comfort,a wandering herdsman
discovered themand reported what he had seen to the ministers and royal servants.Word
spread throughout the palace, making it known to all.When it came to the king’s attention,
he fumed with rage, commanding:“This renunciant is to be sentenced to death by fire,and
she with her servants shall be cast into prison!This could be dangerous! If word gets out,the
surrounding kingdoms will rise as enemies against us.No one may see them! They must be
punished!”The ministers conferred and decreed twenty main punishments.The Guru refrained
from displaying miracles,pretending to be an ordinary person.Thus he was captured by the king’s
men.Oil was poured on the pyre to create a fierce blazethat would burn the Guru’s bound
body.With that, they departed back to their homes.The imprisoned princess and her servantswere
cast into a pit of thorns, where they suffered miserably.After seven days, the king
demandedthat the charred skull of the foreign monk be brought to him.Envoys were dispatched,
and saw as they arrivedthat the smoke had dispersed, but the fire still blazed high.In
the centre was a swirling lake and a blossoming lotus flower.Seated atop its stamen was
the precious Guru,now an eight-year-old child, youthful and vibrant.Amazed, the messengers
fell prostrate before him,and quickly returned to inform the king.Unable to believe it,
with his queen, ministers, and subjects,he went to see for himself.Finding the Guru as described,
all alike felt remorse— king, ministers, queen, and the people at large.Confessing
and begging forgiveness, they bowed at his feet.They invited him to the palace and asked
him to turn the wheel of Dharma,and Mandāravā was presented as his constant companion.The
entire kingdom of Zahor was thus established in the Dharmaand the Guru gained mastery in the
secret mantra of union and liberation.

From A Garland of Vajra Gems: The Life and Liberation of the Guru, this was the fifth chapter:
the Guru Establishes the Dharma in the Kingdom of Zahor and Accomplishes the Level of the
Mahāmudrā Vidyādhara.

6. The Guru’s Travels to Tibet and the Completion of Samyé

The Guru Padmākara with his consortestablished the Dharma in every region of Uḍḍiyāna.Then,
in Bodh Gaya, he tamed all the tīrthikas;he displayed miracles in Vaiśālī,and further established
the genuine Dharmathroughout Kashmir, Khotan, and Mongolia.

Next, is the story of his journey to Tibet.King Trisong Detsen, an emanation of Mañjuśrī,had
been examining the histories of his father and grandfather.Deciding that the emperors of
the last three generationshad merely upheld the tradition of the sacred Dharma,his thought
was that he “must actually seek it!”Meeting with his trusted Tibetan ministers,he resolved
to build Samyé as the foundation for the teachings.But malicious spirits with their magical
powersdestroyed at night whatever the workers had constructed by day,hurling back down
all the earths, rocks, and timbers.The ministers reported their failure to the king,yet he
forbade such an outcome, saying,“I’ll not die with this unfinished,or else this life will
have been utterly pointless!There are many learned siddhas living in India,and I will invite
one to come and tame the land.”

He dispatched to India a swift-footed messengerto invite the great Abbot Bodhisattva to come
to Tibet.On his arrival, he performed a ritual to tame the landbut was unable to subdue the
wickedness by peaceful means.He then told the emperor of a prophecy:“This savage land of
Tibet is filled with demons.Here the eight classes of arrogant spirits are incredibly strong.There
is no way anyone of womb-birth can tame them by peaceful means.Invite Padmākara,
the miraculously born!He will tame this land and fulfil the emperor’s wishes,for none but
he can do this kind of taming.”

Following this advice, a messenger was sent.And so, to benefit beings, the great master began
his journey to Tibet.On the way, he established the Dharma in all of Nepal.He magnetized
the hordes of the eight arrogant spirits,particularly the three demons —Lokmatrin of the
ethereal realms,the yakṣa Gömakha and the nāga Gyongpo.[12]He bound them under command and
oath to strictly keep their pledge.He hid countless treasures throughout the land of Nepal,and
gradually proceeded to Tibet.He bound under oath the upper classes of gods and demons,posting
them henceforth as treasure guardians.He then arrived at Samyé where he met the
emperor and tamed the land,incapacitating gods and demons so that none could cause harm.A
three-storied temple was constructedin the style of the Copper-Coloured Mountain,complete
with the four continents, four subcontinents, and a ring of iron mountains.During the day
it was humans building, and at night it was gods and demons.

In the year of the tiger, the foundation was set,and it was completed in year of the male water
horse.[13]Thus the wishes of the emperor, ministers, and retinue were accomplished.

From A Garland of Vajra Gems: The Life and Liberation of the Guru, this was the sixth chapter:
the Guru’s Travels to Tibet and the Completion of Samyé.

7. The Blazing Beacon of the Dharma Dispels the Darkness of Tibet

The heart-wish of Trisong Detsen had been fulfilledwith the building of the great outer temple.Yet,
still supports of enlightened Body, Speech, and Mind were needed,and he resolved to
commission abbot and master to build them.According to the Guru’s guidance, the supports
of body and mind were duly constructed.Then the king requested that the support of enlightened
speech,the sacred Dharma, be translated into Tibetan.Three translators, led by Vairocana,
were chosen as students for the task.They learned the art of translation and expressed
the meaning accordingly.Moreover, many children were gathered to study translation,and
were later sent to India to translate great tracts of the sublime Dharma.The false views of
the heretics faded and the genuine Dharma was established.The unity of sūtra and mantra,
the great vehicle, spread far and wide.Led by Vimalamitra, the great Kashmiri scholar,many
mahāsiddhas, scholars, and translators were invitedto translate the words of the Buddha,
complete and unabridged,along with their commentaries, all brought from India.The teachings
of sūtra and mantra, the doctrine of Padmākara,Like the rising sun, began to spread throughout
Tibet.

From A Garland of Vajra Gems: The Life and Liberation of the Guru, this was the seventh chapter:
the Blazing Beacon of the Dharma Dispels the Darkness of Tibet.

8. The Guru Hides Treasures in Tibet and Fulfills the Heart Wishes of the Emperor

Now, with his heart wish completely accomplished,Emperor Trisong Detsen held countless feasts
and celebrations.Substantial material offerings were made to the many translatorsas they
were gradually escorted back to their homelands.Meanwhile the abbot Bodhisattva and Padmākararemained,
as requested, in the land of Tibet.The great master made his way to Samyé Chimpu,While
the learned Śāntarakṣita settled in the upper floor of the temple.[14]

One day, the emperor fell ill.Hearing the news, the master left for the Yamalung cave[15]where
he practiced the Protector Amitāyus.On the twenty-first day, in a vision, he saw the maṇḍala
of the Immortal Protector.He requested, “Grant the emperor the empowerment of longevity!”When
the emperor arrived, however, his ministers, in their profanity,created obstacles
which stopped him from receiving the empowerment,and so the opportunity passed.At this,
the master, to ensure their safety,hid the longevity substances and maṇḍala articles at Yamalung.With
the ministers unaware of what he was doing,the emperor mounted the best of steeds
and rode to meet the Guru.He requested empowerment, but the Guru replied,“Now is not the
time, there are no empowerment substances.I have hidden the maṇḍala articles as a treasure.”Devastated,
the emperor again requested empowerment.The master took from their hiding
place the longevity substancesand, whilst bestowing the empowerment, he said:“If you had
not been late last time and had received the empowerment,you, Emperor, would have accomplished
deathless vajra life.However, your evil-minded ministers prevented this from happening.Nevertheless,
due to the strength of your past aspirationsand your unstinting wish to receive
empowerment,thirteen human years will be added to your life.”He again hid the maṇḍala
and longevity substances as a treasure.He traveled further on, throughout the provinces
of Tibet,blessing one hundred and eight sites of practice.He placed in hiding countless precious
and profound Dharma treasuresto bring ever-increasing benefit to beings.

From A Garland of Vajra Gems: The Life and Liberation of the Guru, this was the eighth chapter:
the Guru Hides Treasures in Tibet and Fulfills the Heart Wishes of the Emperor.

9. The Guru Perfects the Benefit of Beings in Tibet, and Sets Out for Other Lands

Then, one day, the emperor gathered togetherall the translators, headed by the master and abbot,to
practice The Ocean of Dharma, Great Gathering of Transmitted Precepts.[16]Afterwards,
they enjoyed extensive festivities.The time then arrived for Tibetan New Year,but the Master
said not to celebrate.The ministers and empress discussed amongst themselves:“Save for
having a good time, what’s the harm in celebrating?It just doesn’t make sense to hold back!We’ll
have a word in private with the emperor.”And, the celebrations went ahead.In the
hills, to the right of Samyé lake,there were to be horse races and archery competitions.The
master said not to take part in the horse race,but the ministers didn’t listen, resolving
to go ahead with the races.The minister Lhazang Lupel, who favoured the Bön religion,Was
full of scorn for the Dharma, and jealous of the king.He fired an arrow from the crowd while
the emperor was riding.It pierced the emperor’s ribs and killed him outright.Although
everyone saw what happened, it was said that a tree root was to blame.There was no investigation,
and it was simply deemed the emperor’s time.

However, with Mutri Tsenpo’s ascent to the thronehis father’s legacy would not fall into decline.The
great master Padmasambhava, to benefit future beings,travelled throughout Tibet,
leaving no place untouched — neither border nor centre —blessing places for practice and hiding
many profound treasures.At the borders and in the heartlands, he built genuine templesand
a hundred and eight stūpas for subjugating māras.At the summit of Samyé Hepori Mountain,together
with Mutri Tsenpo and hundreds of assembled subjects,Guru Padma made gaṇacakra
offerings — one hundred and eight in total.Gathering in their entirety all malicious non-human
and arrogant spirits,he bound them under oath and assigned them their commitments,whereupon
they offered their life essence.Actually present in person, the Guru perfected his
disciples in Tibet.

It was then that the Guru decidedthat it was time to tame the rākṣasas.With Mutri Tsenpo before
him, the Guru spoke:“Son, from the time you were smallyou have been my blessing, the core
of my heart.Now, cleared of the suffering of your father’s passing,you will bring happiness
to this nation and spread the teachings of the Buddha.I go not from displeasure, but
at this time of increasing excellence,I came here to Tibet, have done what was needed and
perfected those to be tamed.Now the time has come to tame the rākṣasas in the south-west.No
master save myself has the ability to tame them.If I do not do this, they will destroy
the Buddhist teachings,for they are the very grounds for the unhappiness of beings.The time
has now come. Only son of mine, be well!Do not forget me, but to me forever pray.When you
have yearning faith, you are worthy of blessing.We will not be apart. I will never leave
you.”

Mutri Tsenpo was upset, still, and said:“I cannot bear the thought of being separated from you.Have
compassion for us — please, stay in Tibet!My father, our great emperor, is no more,
has gone to the skies.If you, our Guru, do not stay, but leave for the land of rākṣasas,Won’t
the valleys of Tibet become desolate and empty?Are beings no longer the focus of your
compassion?Do not leave — please, stay in Tibet!”

The Guru replied, “Mutri Tsenpo, listen!I am the Guru of all beings equally.Are you forcing
me to abandon bodhicitta?If I do not tame the south-western land of rākṣasas,all beings will
sink into the mires of suffering.Then not a word of the sublime Dharma would be heard by
anyone.Would you wish that to happen?I cannot stay, but must be off to tame the rākṣasas.For
anyone, man or woman, who has faith in me,I, the Lotus Born, have never gone away — I
sleep at their threshold.When the morning light rays shine and the evening light rays fade,and
also at dawn on the tenth lunar day,I will always come for the well-being of Tibet.For
my future disciples who will not meet me directly,they should endeavour in making offerings
and paying homageto all supports and places of enlightened body, speech, and mind.To
respect and support the noble Saṅghais equal to making offerings to Padmasambhava of Uḍḍiyāna.My
compassion will never fade.I will always benefit and protect the people of Tibet.”


The emperor and subjects trusted the Guru, though most of them were tearful.No one felt joy;
many wept in sorrow.The laymen and women of Tibet clustered aroundand touched the Mahāguru’s
lotus feet to their crown,Offering whatever wealth or possessions they had.Prince Mutri
Tsenpo, flanked by the empress and ministers,offered gold and silver, and gems of all kinds,silks
soft to touch, and all the luxuries of existence.

Then the Guru spoke: “Listen, people of Tibet!Like the uḍumbara flower, the freedoms and advantages
are hard to find.Like the sun in winter, this human life doesn’t last forever.There
is no end to the sufferings of saṃsāra.So, practice virtue — and your beneficial qualities
will increase.The results of this life’s activities, good and bad,will inevitably ripen
later.Therefore, without distraction, embrace every thought with the Dharma.Place your trust
in the authentic guru, and set him above your crown.Take refuge, generate bodhicitta,
and purify your obscurationsby means of visualization and recitation.Accumulate merit by offering
maṇḍalas, and practice guru yoga.Receive the four empowerments, and mingle your mind
as one with the Guru’s.Liberated upon arising, beyond the intellect’s reach —maintain this
vital point!Bring to completion the result — the four kāyas spontaneously present.”And
so he continued to give many pieces of advice.

From A Garland of Vajra Gems: The Life and Liberation of the Guru, this was the ninth chapter:
the Guru Perfects the Benefit of Beings in Tibet, and Sets Out for Other Lands.

10. The Guru’s Subjugation of the Land of Rākṣasas

As the Guru began his journey to the land of rākṣasas,the emperor and subjects went along to
wave him off.When they reached Mangyul’s upper plainthe master and his companions rested
there for three full days.To the emperor and every subject he gave individual pieces of advice.Then
Khandro Yeshé Tsogyal offered a maṇḍala of gold, turquoise, and jewels,saying, “Knower
of the three times, precious Guru,If you are not going to stay in Tibet, but are leaving
for the land of rākṣasas,do not abandon me, your wife, this woman called Yeshe Tsogyal.Do
not leave me behind! Please be compassionate!”To this, Guru Padma said,“This physical
body of yours cannot go to the land of rākṣasas.At this time, you must secure the benefit
of Tibet.Without our ever being parted, I will meet you in the ranks of the Vidyādharas.”Thus,
she didn’t leave, but stayed to benefit beings.With the binding hook mudrā, the Guru
exclaimed“jaḥ hūṃ baṃ hoḥ hūṃ hūṃ jaḥ hūṃ”.They had brought with them a magnificent steed,
which they presented to the Guru.Then, within swirling rainbow lights, came the words,
“I am Princess Mandāravā.”Carrying a vase of amṛta, she now appeared before the Guruand dissolved
into the khaṭvāṅga.The Guru, taking the reins of the supreme and precious steed,Took
to the open skies of the south-westwith each of the Four Great Kings supporting the horse’s
hooves.Taking his place there, the Guru disguised himself as the king of rākṣasas.He
established the whole of the kingdom in the authentic Dharma,Spreading far and wide the teachings
on bringing benefit to others.

From A Garland of Vajra Gems: The Life and Liberation of the Guru, this was the tenth chapter:
the Guru’s Subjugation of the Land of Rākṣasas.

I, the Lady Tsogyal, transcribed this life and liberation of the Guru into ḍākinī script and
hid it away as a treasure so that beings with the karmic destiny may meet it in the future.
As they meet it, may the benefit of beings flourish!

Samaya!
Body seal!
Speech seal!
Mind seal!

This was received by Pema Garwang Chimé Tennyi Lingpa[17] as a siddhi.

The magical display of the enlightened body, speech, mind, qualities and activitiesof all the
buddhas of the three times residing in infinite realms,endlessly filling the dharmadhātu,
is the life of the Ocean-Born Vajra.It defies imagination.However, as an entryway for fortune
disciples,what is given here is a simple, straightforward, and accessibleVajra testament
— in just a few words.Thanks to the kindness of Lotsawa Jamgön, we encountered them.Let
us dedicate the merit of spreading this publication in manifold waysaccumulated through
Lama Sönam Tseten’s pure motivationSo that all beings, especially our mother and father,
may be reborn in the Guru’s presence.

These words of aspiration were written by Khyentse Tulku for the publication of this text.
