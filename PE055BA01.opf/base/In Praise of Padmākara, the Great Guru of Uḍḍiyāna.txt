Most amazing wonder of these teachings,

Lotus King, mighty lord of this world,
rik ni zahor gyalpö sé su trung
As for your family, you were born a prince of Zahor,
urgyen yul du drondok malü ché
In Uḍḍiyāna you cut through all misconceptions,
silwé tsal du ngödrub nam nyi nyé
And in Śītavana you gained the two forms of attainment.
jikten kham su dukpachen nam tul
Throughout this world you tamed malevolent forces,
khawachen du tenpa gyepar dzé
And in this Snowy Land you spread the teachings.
lho nub tsam su sinpö kha nönpa
In the south-west borderlands now you subjugate the rākṣasas.
nya ngen mida drowé nyen chikpu
Not passing into nirvāṇa, but remaining as beings' only friend,
ku sum yermé chemchok heruka
Supreme heruka in whom the three kāyas are inseparable,
nyammé lama chok dedü dir dren
Supreme guru without equal, I remember you now.
