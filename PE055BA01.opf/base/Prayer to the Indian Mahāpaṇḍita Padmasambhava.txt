Prayer to the Indian Mahāpaṇḍita Padmasambhava
attributed to Menlungpa Mikyö Dorje

gyagar penchen bö la kadrin ché
Indian mahāpaṇḍita, so kind to the land of Tibet;
pema lé trung ku la dé drong mé
Born from a lotus, your enlightened form beyond death;
danta lhonub sinpö kha nön dzé
Now you tame the rākṣasa demons in the south-west—
orgyen rinpoche la solwa dep
Precious master of Oḍḍiyāna, to you I pray!1

This is said to have been composed by Gyalse Menlungpa.

↑ The final three syllables of the prayer are often adapted from ‘solwa dep’ (I pray) to ‘chöpa
bul’ (I present this offering) turning the text into an offering liturgy or tea-offering
prayer.
